Development Codebase

This project uses Git version control hosted on GitHub to ensure collaborative, trackable development.

A public GitHub repository was created for this project.

All Python scripts (app.py, ui.py, database.py) are version-controlled.

Development used branches for major updates (e.g., UI tweaks, CSV export).

Commits include meaningful messages to track progress.

Version control helped manage iterations, track issues, and showcase code quality during demo and peer review.
